Link's Gem Game: on the page load, and on completion of the game, a random number will be generated as a target score. The player then must reach the target score by figuring out the secret numbers of the gems, and clicking them to add 


There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page, along with a random number (generated on page load). 
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The ammount is hidden and changes with each new game cycle. If the player reaches the target score without going over they win, otherwise if they go over they lose. One either outcome the game will reset without the page reloading.
